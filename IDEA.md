# Idea

## Goal

To create an website where event organizers will be able to upload details of excess food remaining after an event and the data along with their location will be recorded. The website will notify nearby Non-Governmental Organisations and provide them contact details of the organizers.

## Considerations

* The website would be mainly used as a Progressive Web App hence should follow certain guidelines. Please go through [this link](https://web.dev/pwa-checklist/) to know more.
* Our future goal would be to use the data collected from users to train a Machine Learning model that would predict the approximate quantity of food to be ordered considering all external factors like location, weather, event time, etc to reduce the wastage. Collect data on Veg/Non-veg, number of people invited, people that turned up, plates ordered and plates remaining.

## Deliverables

* An single page index.html file that will accept the food details and location along with timestamp. The page should begin with a little information about HungOver and end with credits to us.
* A backend database that'll store the details.
